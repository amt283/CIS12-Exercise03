# CIS-12 Chapter 03 Exercises

 <h2> 2. Compare your results with the instructor's GitHub solutions</h2>

- <b>Exercise 3.11.2:</b>

The main thing I notice in comparison is that I used main() as a way to call my functions so I could define the functions without having to call them right away.

- <b>Exercise 3.11.3:</b>

I did something similar to "triangle01()" in the instructor's solutions with a slight variation in that I added the +1 to the range of the loop. 

- <b>Exercise 3.11.4:</b>

I did the same thing as the instructor's "rectangle02()" so there really isn't much to compare :)

- <b>Exercise 3.11.5:</b>

The biggest difference between the two solutions is that the instructor's is much more efficient and, as a result, much more concise. I had wanted to do the same thing with regards to making "bottle" plural only when the number was greater than 1 and wasn't quite sure how to do that, so I think it's really great to see how the instructor did it instead.

 <h2> 3. Ask yourself which solution is better and why?</h2>

- <b>Exercise 3.11.2:</b>

I think my solution is better because it's a lot more concise - though I'm sure the instructor's is longer to show different examples of how it could be done. 

- <b>Exercise 3.11.3:</b>

I think both worth just as well, they achieve the same results with only a slight variation in the process.

- <b>Exercise 3.11.4:</b>

I think both worth just as well, they achieve the same results.

- <b>Exercise 3.11.5:</b>

I think the instructor's solution is much better, it's much more efficient and has less repetition. I also didn't realize you could have "if statements" in formatted strings so I think that's really cool thing to learn.

 <h2> 4. Can either solution be improved and how?</h2>

- <b>Exercise 3.11.2:</b>

I think both are good, but I think if I was creating a program for general use (or wanted it easy to read at a glance) I would stick with mine for its length.

- <b>Exercise 3.11.3:</b>

I think both are good and don't need improvements.

- <b>Exercise 3.11.4:</b>

I think both are good and don't need improvements.

- <b>Exercise 3.11.5:</b>

I think my solution could be improved by following the instructor's example and using if-statements to remove the repetitve lines while still getting the same result.
